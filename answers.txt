Q1.(D) 

-Very Short Texts: Fleschâ€“Kincaid uses average sentence length and syllable count. 
                    For example in a small title/tweet , just a single short sentence or a one long word will throw these averages off. 
                    The score then does not show real reading difficulty.
        
-Specialized language: There are languages which includes names,slang,technical terms, dialogue which does not follow normal English patterns.
                       The syllable counts and sentence structure which it knows is not there so the grade level can be too high or too low.
